## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Overview
Welcome to the README for the Patika.dev Data Structures & Algorithms repository. Here, you'll find descriptions of three essential algorithms: Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Binary Search Tree (BST) Sort. These algorithms are foundational in computer science, facilitating efficient data manipulation and organization.

### Projects
1. **Selection Sort** ðŸ§¹ 
   - This algorithm sorts a list by iteratively identifying the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the beginning.
   
2. **Merge Sort** ðŸ”„ 
   - Merge Sort divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts each sublist, and merges them back together to yield a sorted list.
   
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Sort** ðŸŒ³ 
   - BST Sort entails inserting elements into a binary search tree and performing an in-order traversal to retrieve them in sorted order.
